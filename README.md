🧾 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and testing components of a blockchain-based timestamping system.

📁 Repository Structure

It includes both client-side and smart contract modules for timestamp creation, verification, and blockchain anchoring:

-Client applications for sending timestamping requests (document or hash) to the TSA.

-Client application for submitting timestamp tokens for verification against the blockchain.

-Scripts for testing blockchain connectivity and verifying system correctness.

-Solidity smart contracts used for anchoring timestamp tokens on the blockchain.
